### About ###

This program attempts to predict HQ trivia answers.  Before running the program, an iPhone screen needs to be mirrored to the computer through Quicktime Player.  The program automatically finds this mirrored window, isolates and extracts trivia questions and answers from the window, and performs an online query for prediction.
